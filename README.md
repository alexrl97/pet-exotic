# PetExotic

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.0.

https://github.com/alexrl97/pet-exotic

I've build a social media platform where you can create a profile for your exotic pet, share pictures of it, make friends and interact with other exotic pets and their posts. It comes with an responsive design and Firebase as backend. After going trough the login process you can create a profile and choose of the following options in the button sidebar:

Explore - Shows all Posts from everybody

Followed - Shows only posts from profiles you follow

Friends - Lets you manage ur follows

Posts - Lets you display and delete your own posts

Add post (plus button) - Lets you create a new post

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
